/*
* Description: Based off the highway number the user enters it will display if the given highway is: 
* 1. An interstate or Auxillary highway. 
* 2. If it is an interstate, it will determine if it runs north/south or east/west.
* 3. If it is not an interstate, it will provide which interstate the auxillary highway supports 
* and which direction that interstate runs.
* 4. It makes sure the highway number is a valid number to be considered a highway. 
5. Lastly, it will make sure the interstate the auxillary highway supporst is a valid interstate.
